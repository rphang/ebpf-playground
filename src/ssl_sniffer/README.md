# SSL Sniffer

`ssl_sniffer` is a simple tool to sniff on-going SSL/TLS traffic on the machine without installing, trusting, or modifying any certificate. It will **intercept the raw decrypted SSL/TLS traffic**, and display it on the fly.

## Features

- âœ… Sniff many SSL/TLS libraries (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS)
- âœ… On-the-fly SSL/TLS traffic sniffing (no need to install certificates & restart the application)
- âœ… Bypass SSL Pinning
- ðŸš§ [**Planned**] protocol parsing (HTTP2+)

It supports out-of-the-box the following applications:
- `curl`
- `wget`
- `nginx` (not all versions, some have inbuilt SSL/TLS support)
& many more...

## Usage

```bash
$ sudo ./ssl_sniffer
libssl.so probes attached to ...
```

From there, any application making uses of the system's SSL/TLS libraries will be sniffed. The output will be displayed on the terminal.

```bash
$ sudo ./ssl_sniffer
...
Press Ctrl+C to stop

## How it works

`ssl_sniffer` is an eBPF program that will be attached to various uprobe and kprobe events to intercept the SSL/TLS traffic. It supports the following libraries:
- OpenSSL
- GnuTLS
- NSS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Despite trying to sniff most of the SSL/TLS traffic, some applications might not be appearing in the traffic. This is because the application might be **using a different non supported SSL/TLS library**, **bringing their own library** in a directory which is not being sniffed or have **inbuilt SSL/TLS support**. It would still be possible to hijack them if we know their paths and trying to guess func. by their DWARF info.
>
> The hardest case is when the statically compiled application is using **non-standard SSL/TLS libraries** and have **no DWARF info**. In this case, it's better to give up unless we know the functions locations.

## Requirements

- Kernel version **>= 5.8** (could be lower but that requires to ditch ring buffer's and replace them with perf buffers)

Tested on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (kernel 5.15.0-106-generic)

## Extra

A `bpftrace_demo.sh` script is provided to try to sniff any encrypted SSL/TLS traffic on specified programs. It will use `bpftrace` to compile and load the eBPF program. It's a simplier version of the `ssl_sniffer` tool with truncated output.
